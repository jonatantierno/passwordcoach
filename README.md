# passwordcoach
Android application to analyze the strength of a password and help users improve their password-based security.

Thanks to Dropbox for Zxcvbn, that I am using as a password meter (https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) and to Nulab Inc for the port to Java  (https://github.com/nulab/zxcvbn4j)

Also using https://github.com/wuman/android-oauth-client and http://twitter4j.org. The application may connect to Twitter for simulating personalized Dictionary attacks based in a twitter account. In order to make this work, credentials must be created for the application. This credentials are stored in a resource file that has not been uploaded to the server for security.
